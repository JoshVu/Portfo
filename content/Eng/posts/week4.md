This is the final week and my final goal is to able to hack my way through a machine on hackthebox.eu and also present my work at Studio Expo 

For the machine on hackthebox.eu, It took me whole week searching online for some walk-through of retired machine, because hackthebox doesn't allow user to post walk-through about active machine, to get the basic idea about what tools i should use when hack into a machine

Although all the walk-through that I found is very clear, but all machine is different, i was managed to find available vulnerability of an active machine Curling on Hackthebox, but I still stuck at getting through admin panel of the machine.
But with the help of tutors from my studio, I was able to go deeper and exploit that machine

Because i can't post my write-up pulic so if anyone need a hint for Curling machine, you can contact me for more infomation

# Expo

At Expo, I have a chance to present my work to one of the students, and it was a great opportunity for me because I never have a chance to speak at an Expo before.
