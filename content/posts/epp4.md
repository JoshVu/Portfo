On 28th February 2019, my Peer Review Group (PRG) and I had our second “Professional Assessment Activity,” and we were giving our final feedback on our e-portfolio.


This activity is very similar to the first Activity, we also took the turn to give feedback, but this time, since everyone already known how to finalize the work, we focus more on how we had fix previous problem.


My PRG  still using Wix and they did very well on fixing the problem that we point out since last time. One of them even has an animation background which looked very great and still doesn’t make the visitor feel annoyed.


Since my PRG was mostly new to making a website, so they mainly focus on putting content on it and now care very much about the look of their site, and that can cause some visitor hard to follow their content, especially mobile user. So I talk to them about how to choose the font and color of their website, so it doesn’t make the visitor feel tire when trying to go through the content of their site.


For me, since I also enrolled in another subject call Summer Studio and from that, I know how to make a website on my own, so I decided to make my website that way. My PRG very like my site, from the way I choose the themes to how I organize it. But still, my Journal still not very clear and I need to make more improvement on it.
