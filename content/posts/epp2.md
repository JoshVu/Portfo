This summer, I’m also taking UTS’ Summer Studio program, and there was an event at the end of the studio call Summer Studio EXPO.


The event is a place where all student, staff and also company can come to see projects of students who are taking on this Studio, I was given a chance to present my work which is breaking into a machine, provided by the Leader of my Studio, about how I did it, how I approached and resolve the problem along the way. I also receive feedback from an IT company about my work and about carrier opportunity that they are given out now. I was able to check on other Studio and here out how a company from that field is looking for an internship. Most companies nowadays look for Engineer and Software developer more than business, and 70% of them look for people that have mics set of skill like Engineering with Software and IT skill, or Cyber Security with Mechatronic skill

I realize that for me to have a high chance of getting a job, I should have more than just those skill from my major or I may not be able to compete to others in the job market
