## This week self-learning so far

This week was pretty tough for me because all the problem that I have with my static site from week 1 still exist and I have to prioritize solving them first. But i was still able to keep up with the studio. This week engaging with Luke from Cyber Security team was very helpful for me. I got to understand what is the red and blue team, how to approach security as a red and blue team. Luke's presentation also gives out some useful tools for web security also and it really great
