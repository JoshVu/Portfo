On Thursday, 14th February 2019, my Peer Review Group (PRG) and I had our first “Professional Assessment Activity.”


We were giving each member of our group feedback on our website using the Feedback Sandwich method that was covered on Tutorial 1 of EPP1. And we must use the Professional Assessment Activity Form to note down our feedback and comment form others.


Following the Feedback Sandwich method, I first give out positive feedback than negative or part the might need to fix and ended with a positive note. We all have to write down all the key feedback that we received from others.


The activity was beneficial for us because we cannot always see all our problem and still need someone to point it out for us. And, I can practice giving feedback to other which I’ve never done before, I also learn about the decisive point that I had and what I still need to work harder to make my website perfect.


Since we all are using Wix, it was easy for us to give out feedback on the website cause we all know how it works, for my site, the primary concern of my PRG is that my Journal at that time was too short. And I now have fixed that by adding more content relating to subject to it. And the quote of myself is what my PRG liked most about my website at that time.


According to Schell, W. & Hughes, B. 2017, ‘An Approach to Understand the Role of Identity in Engineering Leadership,’ having an engineering identity is an essential part of becoming an engineer and being a part of this community. I think it’s the most necessary part of the engineer, with that people are more accessible for the company to know who you are, and you can show it to everyone with ease. Also, this e-portfolio is not just for the subject but also for our future career. So, I have to make it as good as I can.
