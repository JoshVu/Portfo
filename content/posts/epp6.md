Hesitation and anxiety and even a little depression; however, it's acceptable for you to have those bad feelings, don't worry, you will soon get out of it. As usual, the company will offer you a supervisor to help and check your work. Your supervisor might be a nice guy, always want to help you with different tasks of your job, help you to develop yourself and involved with the company, or, he or she will be someone who makes you feel more anxious and stressful. For the first case, if you have chances to work with a nice person, then you will be able to increase all of your abilities.


Moreover, It will develop yourself at your best if you're a fast learner and hard working type. Otherwise, you will work with a person who you don't have any good impressions with, someone who try to make bad effects on you, try to accuse you of mistakes and even want to kick you out of the company. In this case, you have to talk to your boss about your situation, about your relationship with your supervisor, try to provide evidence if someone wants to harm you. Finally, if you can't find a way to solve your problem, maybe you should consider finding a new company, but, this choice should be the last thing you can think about because before you want to abandon your job, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF FIRST.
