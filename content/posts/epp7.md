41035 Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) has help me a lot on my way to find a job. And it also help me realize how important to write a good Resume and Cover letter as well as make my e-portfolio
After 6 weeks of listening to guest speaker, writing resume and journal, designing my e-portfolio, I was able to achieve things that I have never done before. Which is:


•	Writing a resume and make my own website: this aligned with SLO 1: Articulate preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace. I now have a job-ready resume and my own website where I can update my progress of learning and working, which now I know is very important if I want to get my dream job. EPP1 helped me not just to achieve this but also achieve it in a finesse way so I can compete on job market.


•	Writing learning journals and tutorial classes activities: with this, I was able to achieved SLO 2: Document and communicate their capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning. The example videos that we had to watch in out tutorial were interesting. It really gives us an idea of how things can go many different way when we started an internship. And the skill of documenting and writing journal is also help me on many situation outside of EPP1, as I was taking on UTS’ Summer Studio which I need to write journals as well.
After taking EPP1, I now feel more confident to apply for an internship and job. Thanks you!
