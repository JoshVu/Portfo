##About this week

This week we are asked to break into a vulnerable machine, and it was very hard for me because I have no idea on how to break into the machine. But after being shown a demo, I felt more confident and was able to find more material on the internet to start trying to break into a machine that I found on the internet.

Later in the week, we have a chance to meet with people from Deloitte Cyber Attack Team to talk about pen-testing, and they gave us a chance to break into their vulnerable machine, I wasn't able to break into it but after they show me how to do it, I was able to understand more about pentesting, and it helps me a lot when I try to break through the machine that I found earlier this week
