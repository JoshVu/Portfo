##About this week

This week we are asked to break into a vulnerable machine, and it was very hard for me because I have no idea on how to break into the machine. But after being shown a demo, I felt more confident and was able to find more material on the internet to start trying to break into a machine that I found on the internet.

Later in the week, we have a chance to meet with people from Deloitte Cyber Attack Team to talk about pen-testing, and they gave us a chance to break into their vulnerable machine, I wasn't able to break into it but after they show me how to do it, I was able to understand more about pentesting, and it helps me a lot when I try to break through the machine that I found earlier this week

We also did some research about password hacking tools, and I really into this because being able to hack someone or some machine password can grand you access to 80% of the machine and that important when you want to break into a device. Doing this research also give me an inside view of how it works when coming to password hacking is that it just keep trying as many combinations as it can in the library that you give to it. But by knowing how it works, I can find a shorter way to hack a password like creating a more concise library that closest to the owner password.

Throughout the week, after doing some research and looking for instruction on the Internet, I was able to break into the machine that I've found earlier this week.

But it wasn't easy from the beginning. At first, I tried using Metasploit, an exploit tools from Linux, but instead of giving me access to my machine IP address, it directs me to the default IP 0.0.0.0 and it really hold me back a lot
