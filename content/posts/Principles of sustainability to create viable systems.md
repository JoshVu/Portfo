When I first started working for NhatTinh, my position was to work in Assembly team and I got to work on the company straight away. The company produces robot base on the customer order which mostly come from other big company.

Starting my intern in Assembly team, my job was to assemble small part and also check if there are any error, from the part different from the design, even to the small detail that make assemble process difficult and fix it or returned it. At first, I was doing this job by accept almost everything and I almost report nothing back even if I couldnâ€™t get 2 part together and fix everything I can by myself.

Because the device is fairly complex though, doing so meant that I ended up losing several parts, doing extra research and wasting lots of time. My job supervisor then recommended that I would look at it from a more pragmatic point of view: try to gradually and thoughtfully fix issues, without altering the current state of the damaged units, and seek to find the root cause of problems that may occur on multiple units, not just fixing the particular unit.

This was a new way of looking at engineering problems to me, as previously I had only worked on university projects, and in that case, getting things to work was the priority.
As I continued to work with the company, I applied that way of thinking and it helped me and my team create viable solutions for both hardware and software engineering. I will continue to use it for future, personal as well as technical ventures..
