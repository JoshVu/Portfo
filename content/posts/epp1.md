When I was in high school, my friend and I were working as a volunteer for a summer campaign. We were asked to create the playground for children every Tuesday and Thursday of summer so that parent can leave their kid with us and go to work, and the kid can have a place to make friend and play.


It’s my first time I had to create and guide a playground, so I was very nervous because if I fail the first time, people may not come for the next day, and that now what we wanted because we were supposed to made and guided the playground through 2 months of summer.


But the most difficulty was not about made a playground, guiding and playing with children was the most challenging thing that my friend and I had to deal with cause it not easy to tell them to do precisely to what you tell them, and for young people like us, it easy to make them cry and that can cause us a lot of trouble.


And since it the first time we did this, it hard to avoid all the mistake. On the 3rd week of summer, it was raining most of the time, and we must move to a classroom of the nearby school, and we had to come up with the new set of games to fit the classroom area. And while we were working on a new game, we completely forgot about the kids, and one of them started hitting other kid, and that kid started to cry, my friend and I were utterly panic and the first reaction that one of my friends made was yell at them and others began to panic not know what to do. It was entirely a big mess at that time, my friend yelling, the kid crying, the noise of other kids and my friend all mix make it even harder to calm them down, and because we were told not to yell at them, we could also be reprimanded after this.


The reason my friend chose to yell at the kid is what he used to treat his brother at home, and it was completely wrong way to treat a kid. At that time, I thought whether I should report back to Leader of the campaign or should I tried to resolve it my way because I have different way when it come to this situation, and I’m glad that I choose to resolve it instead of report back. I told my friend to calm down and let me talk to the kid, and I started to ask them why they were fighting each other, it turns out the kid that was being hit was making fun of other kid weight, and he got completely mad, so he hit this kid. I then explained to them that hit other and make fun about other body are bad, because kids are hard to tell but also a very great listener, I was able to make them sorry each other, and we were all good


I’m very glad that day I choose to solve the problem instead of report back immediately because if I report back, I could take a very long time for the leader to come to our place because I was raining and he has to check on another group also and leaving the kid to cry not just because of him being hit, but also my friend was yelling at him. And by resolving that by myself I now can believe in my decision more, instead of asking for another every time, and also I can prove my leadership skill to others.
