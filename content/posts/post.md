## Every problem and issue i have encounter so far

When making my portfolio using hugo and netlify, i have face a lot of problem that prevent me from upload my site to Github, most of them was because of my input was missing some word in my code that make the github can not fine the path to it. But there are 2 problem that really give me a headache, one is that some themes work just fine for my local host, but when i upload it to Netlify and publish it, the them bug out and only work on my landing page. The other one is also about the theme but different in term of problem, some theme on github have problem in their file like missing file or incompleted file and that make Netlify can not build my site.



## How do i solve those problem 

At first really don't know what those problem really are, so i go through all my code and the output on Visual Studio Code and still can find any error or wrong input that made by me, so i reach out to my tutor in Summer Studio for solution, but still can not solve it either. So my solution for those problem right now is just to change to another theme (myself recommend to use simple theme like hello friend)
